# Credit Risk Modeling in Python üè¶

## Overview üî•

This project focuses on analyzing data to assess **credit risk** of customers for financial institutions or banks. Through exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, and modeling, the goal is to build a system that predicts the likelihood of a customer becoming a credit risk.

## Dataset [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1JyzAj-llRy60zJQT41-6h1MozSutb14H?usp=sharing] üìä

The dataset consists of **3006 customers** with the following characteristics:

- **ƒê·ªô tu·ªïi**: Age of the borrower (in years).  
- **Gi·ªõi t√≠nh**: Gender of the borrower (e.g., Male, Female).  
- **T√¨nh tr·∫°ng h√¥n nh√¢n**: Indicates whether the borrower is single, married, divorced, etc.  
- **Tr√¨nh ƒë·ªô h·ªçc v·∫•n**: Highest education level attained by the borrower.  
- **T√¨nh tr·∫°ng c√¥ng vi·ªác hi·ªán t·∫°i (s·ªë nƒÉm kinh nghi·ªám)**: Number of years the borrower has been employed.  
- **S·ªë th√†nh vi√™n ph·ª• thu·ªôc trong gia ƒë√¨nh**: Total number of people financially dependent on borrower.  
- **T√¨nh tr·∫°ng s·ªü h·ªØu nh√† ·ªü**: Indicates if the borrower owns, rents, or lives with family.
- **Thu nh·∫≠p**: Monthly income of the borrower.  
- **S·ªë ti·ªÅn d·ª± ki·∫øn vay**: The amount of money the borrower wants to borrow.  
- **Ch·ª©ng minh thu nh·∫≠p**: Whether the borrower can provide income documentation.  
- **Th·ªùi h·∫°n kho·∫£n vay**: Duration of the loan in months.  
- **T√†i s·∫£n th·∫ø ch·∫•p**: Indicates whether the borrower offers any assets as collateral.  
- **Chi ti√™u (trung b√¨nh m·ªôt th√°ng)**: Average monthly spending of the borrower.  
- **M·ª•c ƒë√≠ch vay**: Reason for applying for the loan (e.g., Education, Business, etc). 
- **H√≥a ƒë∆°n ti·ªÅn ƒëi·ªán**: Average monthly electricity bill of the borrower's household.
===============================================================================================
- **15 explanatory variables** (excluding customer ID)
- **7 integer variables (int64)**
- **2 float variables (float64)**
- **8 categorical variables (object)**
- Some columns contain missing values, including:
  - *Marital status*
  - *Years of work experience*
  - *Electric bill*
  - *Education level*

## Objectives üéØ

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Understand distribution of numerical features such as age, income, expenses, electric bill, loan amount, loan term, number of dependents.
   - Analyze categorical features like gender, loan purpose, marital status, education, occupation, etc.
   - Visualize insights using `seaborn`, `matplotlib`.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handle missing values using interpolation, imputation, or removal where necessary.
   - Encode categorical features using One-Hot Encoding or Label Encoding.
   - Normalize numerical features if required for modeling.

3. **Outlier Detection**:
   - Use techniques like IQR, Z-score, or models like Isolation Forest to detect and handle outliers.

4. **Model Building for Risk Prediction**:
   - Use machine learning algorithms:
     - **Logistic Regression**
     - **Random Forest**
     - **XGBoost / LightGBM**
   - Evaluate models using:
     - Confusion Matrix
     - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
     - ROC-AUC

5. **Real-world Application**:
   - Integrate model into credit scoring systems.
   - Support lending decisions by credit departments.
